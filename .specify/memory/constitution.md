# Hackathon-5-phases Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Rapid Prototyping
Every feature should be developed with speed and efficiency in mind; Solutions must be functional and demonstrate core concepts; Clear focus required - no over-engineering during hackathon phases

### II. Modular Architecture
Each component should be designed as a standalone module; Modules must be independently testable and reusable; Well-defined interfaces required - clear input/output specifications

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → Requirements validated → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced during development phases

### IV. Collaborative Development
Focus areas requiring collaboration: Code reviews between team members, Shared responsibility for deliverables, Cross-functional skill sharing

### V. Documentation-Driven Development
All code must include essential documentation; Inline comments for complex logic required; Clear README files for each major component

### VI. Continuous Integration
All code changes must pass automated checks; Regular integration of features to prevent divergence; Automated testing pipeline required for all pull requests

## Development Workflow
Technology stack requirements: As specified in project requirements; Deployment policies: Functional demo required at end of each phase; Code review requirements: At least one team member must approve changes

## Quality Standards
Code quality requirements: Clean, readable, and maintainable code; Performance targets: As specified in project requirements; Security considerations: Basic security practices must be followed

## Governance
This constitution governs all development practices; Amendments require team consensus and lead developer approval; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles
