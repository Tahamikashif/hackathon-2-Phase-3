# Deployment Script for AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

## Backend Deployment

### To deploy the backend to Vercel:

1. Make sure you have Vercel CLI installed:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd C:\Users\CSC\Desktop\Hackathon-5-phases\Hackathon-2\phase-3\backend
```

3. Login to Vercel (if not already logged in):
```bash
vercel login
```

4. Deploy the backend:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

5. During the deployment, you'll be prompted to set environment variables:
   - Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to your OpenRouter API key
   - Set `DATABASE_URL` to your Neon database connection string

## Frontend Deployment

### To deploy the frontend to Vercel:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd C:\Users\CSC\Desktop\Hackathon-5-phases\Hackathon-2\phase-3\frontend
```

2. Update the config file to point to your deployed backend:
Edit `src/config.js` and set:
```javascript
API_BASE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL || 'https://your-backend-deployed-url.vercel.app'
```

3. Deploy the frontend:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

4. Set the environment variable:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The URL of your deployed backend

## Important Notes

- The backend must be deployed first, as the frontend needs the backend URL
- After deploying the backend, copy its URL to configure the frontend
- Both deployments will generate unique URLs ending in `.vercel.app`
- Remember to set all required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
